No need to install anything or run anything as admin! Just do the following things:

0) move or renam any pdfs or csv files in this folder!
1) put the classes.csv file in this folder (named exactly!!)
2) doubleclick on the bat file
3) open your new PDF (and move to a new location!)

The following files must be present to work:
- RUNME.bat
- paper-classes.typ
- typst.exe
- classes.csv
