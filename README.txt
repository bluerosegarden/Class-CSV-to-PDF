No need to install anything or run anything as admin! Just do the following things:

0) make sure any csv or pdf files you want to keep are moved out of this folder!
1) Acquire a class.csv of the classes you want (use the bookmarklet js code in bookmarket.js on the JCCC site!)
2) put the classes.csv file in this folder (named exactly!!)
3) doubleclick on the bat file and give the file a name (without the .pdf!)
4) open your new PDF! (and move to a new location!)

The following files must be present to work:
- RUNME.bat
- paper-classes.typ
- typst.exe
- classes.csv

Everything else can be deleted if needed.
